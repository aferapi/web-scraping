## Understanding CAPTCHA in Web Scraping:
CAPTCHA refers to the challenges that web scrapers encounter while extracting data from websites. CAPTCHAs are implemented as a security measure to prevent automated bots from accessing and gathering information. These challenges typically involve tests that are easy for humans to pass but difficult for bots to solve.

## Reasons for Encountering CAPTCHA during Web Scraping:
Websites use CAPTCHAs to protect their content and prevent unauthorized access. CAPTCHAs are commonly found on websites with valuable or restricted data or those aiming to prevent excessive traffic or scraping activities. When web scrapers encounter CAPTCHA, they must find a way to solve it in order to continue extracting the desired data.

## Solving CAPTCHA during Web Scraping:
Solving CAPTCHA challenges during web scraping requires robust strategies. Manual intervention, where a human solves CAPTCHAs as they arise, is one option, but it can be time-consuming and inefficient.

Automated CAPTCHA solving techniques offer a more efficient solution. These techniques involve using algorithms and tools to recognize and solve CAPTCHA challenges without human intervention. By integrating automated CAPTCHA solving services into their scraping workflows, developers can overcome CAPTCHA challenges and extract the desired data more effectively.

Web scraping developers can explore libraries and APIs that offer CAPTCHA solving services. These services provide pre-trained models and algorithms capable of accurately solving different types of CAPTCHAs, such as image-based and text-based challenges.

# Consider using environment variables for sensitive information
PROXY = "http://username:password@host:port"
capsolver.api_key = "Your Capsolver API Key"
PAGE_URL = "PAGE_URL"
PAGE_KEY = "PAGE_SITE_KEY"

def solve_recaptcha_v2(url,key):
    solution = capsolver.solve({
        "type": "ReCaptchaV2Task",
        "websiteURL": url,
        "websiteKey":key,
        "proxy": PROXY
    })
    return solution


def main():
    print("Solving reCaptcha v2")
    solution = solve_recaptcha_v2(PAGE_URL, PAGE_KEY)
    print("Solution: ", solution)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
